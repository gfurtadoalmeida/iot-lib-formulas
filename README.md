# IoT Formulas Library

A **C** library with functions for common formulas used in the electronic field.  

## Characteristics

* Portable-ish: only "double" is not portable.
* Testable: every function has a test.
* Independent: doesn't rely on other libraries or frameworks.

## Formulas

* Thermistor:
  * Calculate [Steinhart-Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhart%E2%80%93Hart_equation) coefficients.
  * Calculate temperature using Steinhart-Hart coefficients.
  * Calculate temperature using [Steinhart-Hart Betha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor) equation
  * Calculate resistance using inverse Steinhart-Hart Betha equation.
* Voltage Divider:
  * Resistive:
    * Calculate voltage in.
    * Calculate voltage out.
    * Calculate resistor 1 resistance.
    * Calculate resistor 2 resistance.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository and copy the ["lib"](/lib/) folder onto your project.
2. Include files from the ["include"](/lib/include) folder in your code.

## How to Use

For the time being, look at the [header files](/lib/include/), tests and the test runner ðŸ˜….  

As soon as I have time and this library stabilizes I'll write the documentation. Every function has intellisense helpers.

## Project Structure

```text
/
| .vscode               : VS Code configurations
|-- lib
    |-- include         : Includes that can be used by dependent projects
    |-- private_include : Includes that only the library can use
    |-- src             : Implementation files
|-- test                : Test runner and tests
```

## Development Guidelines

* Be as portable as possible, striving to use `stdint`, `stdbool` etc.
* Avoid `malloc`.
* Create tests for every functionality.

## Build Requirements

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/): 3.8+
* C/C++ compiler: I'm using [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).
* [CppUTest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest): will be downloaded by CMake.

## Testing

1. Build the library: `ctrl+shif+p -> CMake: Build`.
2. Run the tests: `F5`.

## To Do

* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] Task for building, testing and debugging on VS Code
* [ ] Scripts for building, testing and debugging without VS Code
